### About

This is a Udacity project. In this project we are going to help IBM student community to get the best recommendations of articles based on the historical interactions data between users and articles. 

we are also making sure that new users also get good recommendations with our recommendation system , so to in this project we implemented all the different types of recommendation systems using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

    1. Knowledge Based Recommendations

    2. Collaborative Filtering Based Recommendations
        Within Collaborative Filtering, there are two main branches:

            1. Model Based Collaborative Filtering (FunkSVD)
            2. Neighborhood Based Collaborative Filtering 

    3. Content Based Recommendations ( No completed , but it will be soon)
